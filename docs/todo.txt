1. Find a way to show a preview to users entering contents in an admin page
2. Fix the behavior on translating long blocks of text. We need a routine to
break the contents in logical sequences of text, which are complete. Avoid the
following scenarios:

 a) In html text, that tags are broken and that words are broken
 b) In normal text, that words are broken

The current implementation just splits the text observing a maximum number of
words that can be sent at a time.
